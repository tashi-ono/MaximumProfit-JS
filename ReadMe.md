# Stock Maximum Profit

You will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is to return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on. 

For example if the input is: 

```
[45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] 
```
Then your program should return 16 because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was made and this is the largest profit that could be made. 

If no profit could have been made, return -1.

# Algorithm

We'll solve the challenge the following way:

1. Iterate through each number in the list.
2. At the ith index, get the i+1 index price and check if it is larger than the ith index price.
3. If so, set buy_price = i and sell_price = i+1. Then calculate the profit: sell_price - buy_price.
4. If a stock price is found that is cheaper than the current buy_price, set this to be the new buying price and continue from step 2.
5. Otherwise, continue changing only the sell_price and keep buy_price set.

This algorithm runs in linear time, making only one pass through the array, so the running time in the worst case is O(n).

# Example

Here is an example of the values that are set through each iteration of the stock prices.

```
input = [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11]

buy_price = 0
sell_price = 0
max_profit = -1

At i = 0
buy_price = 45
sell_price = 24
max_profit = -1

At i = 1
buy_price = 24
sell_price = 35
max_profit = 11

At i = 2
buy_price = 24
sell_price = 31
max_profit = 7

At i = 3
buy_price = 24
sell_price = 40
max_profit = 16

At i = 4
buy_price = 24
sell_price = 38
max_profit = 14

At i = 5
buy_price = 24
sell_price = 11
max_profit = -1

Loop is done
max_profit = 16
```
